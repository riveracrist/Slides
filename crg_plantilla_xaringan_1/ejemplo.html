Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

# Tabla estática

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,


```r
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Sepal.Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Sepal.Width &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Petal.Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Petal.Width &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Species &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

````
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
*{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```
````
Output:

```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!") 
}
```

```
## Very important!
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.

# Personalización 2

An example of using the trailing comment `#&lt;&lt;` to highlight lines:

````markdown
```{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #&lt;&lt;
  geom_smooth()    #&lt;&lt;
```
````

Output:


```r

* geom_smooth()
```

# Personalización 3

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````


```
